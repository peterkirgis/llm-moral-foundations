Exception raised when a language model API fails to respond.
    
    This exception occurs when:
    - The language model API cannot be reached (network error)
    - The API request times out
    - The service is unavailable or overloaded
    - Authentication fails (in some cases)
    
    This exception is used in the retry mechanism for handling model API failures,
    particularly during interviews and asynchronous operations.
    
    To fix this error:
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Verify that the language model service is operational
    3. Increase timeout settings if dealing with complex requests
    4. Check API keys and authentication if applicable
    5. Consider implementing exponential backoff retry logic
    
    Examples:
        ```python
        # API timeout during a model call
        model.generate(prompt=""Very complex prompt"", timeout=1)  # Raises LanguageModelNoResponseError if timeout is too short
